**Install Python**
===========

In the autumn semester of 2023, we will be following the guidelines in the Mathematics 1
and Computer Programming courses. These guidelines can be found 
`here <https://02002.compute.dtu.dk/installation/index.html>`__.

   Following these steps will quickly give you a minimal functioning Python installation.
   These steps follow the recommended DTU procedure ({{pref_symbol}}).

      .. grid-item-card:: 1. Install Python

         Download and install Python {{python_version}} from `here <python-org-down_>`__

         | **Important**: For Windows users, ensure to :far:`square-check` the ``Add Python {{python_version}} to PATH`` box.
         | Go `here <install-python>`_ if you encounter problems.

      .. grid-item-card:: 2. Install VSCode 

         Download from `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`__

         Then `add extensions <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace>`__.
         Find the ``Python`` extension which is verified (:fas:`certificate`) by Microsoft.

         Ensure your `Python interpreter <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_manually-specify-an-interpreter>`__ points to the just installed Python version.

      .. grid-item-card:: 3. Virtual Environments (recommendation!)

         Please use virtual environments so your Python codes works across courses.
