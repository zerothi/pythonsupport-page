Terminal
=================

The terminal, also known as the command line or console, is a powerful tool that allows you to directly interact with your operating system via text-based commands. It provides a way to directly execute 
commands, run scripts, and manage operations without the need for a graphical interface.

Python support aims to assist in any operating system that students might use. 
While there may be occasional challenges with less common operating systems, 
the most frequently used ones, such as Windows, macOS, and major Linux distributions, will be supported.

Common for all of the operating systems is the use of terminals to get packages installed.
The Conda installer and several IDE's such as :ref:`Spyder <ide-spyder>`/:ref:`VS Code <ide-vscode>`/:ref:`PyCharm <ide-pycharm>` installation integrations
can ease the package installation process significantly. However, sometimes it might be necessary
to run commands on the terminal to ensure proper installation and ensure a consistent environment.
