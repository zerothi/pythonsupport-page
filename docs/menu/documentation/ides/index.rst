Editors / IDE's
========================================


IDE's is an engineers integral work-horse for creating and executing code.
Any code, in any language, can be written in any text-editor. However,
integrated development environments (IDE's) will extend the editor functionality
and aid the programmer in various ways, either by creating tooltips when typing code
or spell checking, and many other things.
Therefore choosing and becoming comfortable with an IDE can greatly improve
the turn around for the developer.
