VScode
======

VScode is the place to write your python code. Below you will find the most important tips to get started. 





Making a Python-file
-------------------

.. card::      
    

    You can create a python file in VScode. This is useful if you are writing code, that you want to save for later or reuse. 

            .. tab-set::

                .. tab-item:: Windows 

                    Press the "File" button in the top left corner of the screen. Select "New File". Select "Python File" from the menu that drops down. 

                .. tab-item:: Mac

                    Press the "File" button in the top left corner of the screen. Select "New File". Select "Python File" from the menu that drops down.

                .. tab-item:: Linux

                    Press the "File" button in the top left corner of the screen. Select "New File". Select "Python File" from the menu that drops down.



Selecting the right interpreter
------------------------------

.. card::

    Once you've created a python file you need to selecet the interpreter. 

    #. Press "CTRL" + "Shift" +"p"
    #. type "python: select interpreter" and press once this shows up under the options 
    #. Choose the option similar to "Python 3.11.5 ('base')" (the numbers may be different on your own PC)

.. tip::

    pressing "CTRL" + "Shift" +"p" brings down a search bar where you can search for anything you need help with

.. tip::

    Once you've selected the right interpreter you can run all the code in your python file by clicking the playbutton icon in the top right of the screen.



Terminal in VScode 
-------------------


.. card::      
    

    You can start a terminal from VScode, which works just like in the terminal app. 

            .. tab-set::

                .. tab-item:: Windows 

                    Press the three dots in the top menu bar. They are next to the "View" and "Go" options. Move your mouse to "Terminal" and click "New Terminal"

                .. tab-item:: Mac

                    Move your mouse to the top of the screen. Selcet "Terminal" followed by "New Terminal"

                .. tab-item:: Linux

                    Move your mouse to the top of the screen. Selcet "Terminal" followed by "New Terminal"



Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

Jupyter notebooks give you a way to combine python code, and usual readable text similar to a word document. 

.. card:: Creating a jupyter notebook

    #. Press "CTRL" + "Shift" + "p"
    #. Search for "Create: new Jupyter Notebook" and press
    #. Press the "Select Kernel" button in the top right
    #. Click "Python Environments" and "3.11.5 ('base') (numbers may be different on your own pc)"


.. card:: Code blocks and Text Blocks

    If you hover your mouse around the top of the notebook two icons will appear. "+ Code" and "+ Markdown".
    Press "+ Code" to create a code block.
    You can execute the code in a block by pressing the play-button next to the code block or pressing "Shift"+"Enter".

    Markdown cells allow you to type plain text. Running these cells will just print completely normal text. 



.. warning:: 
    If it is your first time creating a notebook, running a code block may give you the following error:
    **"Running cells with 'base (python 3.11.5)' requires the ipykernel package"**. 
    Simply click install and wait for the code to run
